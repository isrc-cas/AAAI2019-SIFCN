#Scale Invariant Fully Convolutional Network: Detecting Hands Efficiently

##Introduction
This is a tensorflow implementation of Scale Invariant Fully Convolutional Network: Detecting Hands Efficiently. 
A new Scale Invariant Fully Convolutional Network (SIFCN) trained in an end-to-end fashion is proposed to detect hands efficiently.
We design the UF (Unweighted Fusion) block and CWF (Complementary Weighted Fusion) block to fuse features of multiple layers efficiently.
